## Types of Personal Data We Collect (and Why)

Here's a summary of the personal information we've collected over the past 12 months, along with the reasons why, and how we use it:

### Customer Information

We need your name, contact details, and address to manage your account and deliver our services (like shipping products, sending updates, and handling any legally required aspects).

We also use this information to improve our services, and for targeted marketing with your permission.

We'll use your email to share news about our products, app updates, and relevant webinars.

We use this information to make sure our services are right for you, to help with laboratory sample analysis, and in our research efforts.

## How We Use Your Data

Our main goal is to research how diet impacts health.

Your information helps us provide support, meet legal requirements, and achieve other purposes as explained above.
